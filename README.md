# Linear GAN Models

This repository consists of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models that can be used to plot a quadratic or cubic function. This can be used as a reference point for those who are struggling to train linear models for their projects using GANs. 

## Introduction

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.

GANs were introduced in a paper by Ian Goodfellow and other researchers at the University of Montreal, including Yoshua Bengio, in 2014. Referring to GANs, Facebook’s AI research director Yann LeCun called adversarial training “the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in ML.”

## How to use the Code

You can clone this repository and used in your software of choice. I used Google Colaboratory in my case. I have tried my best to add comments wherever an explanantion is needed.
